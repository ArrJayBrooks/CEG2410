## Drives & Drivers

**NOTE** All numbers for speed can vary depending on who wrote the article.  Numbers referred to here may be more of an average.  

### Disk Types

- HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
    - rotary hard drives with spinning platters and a moving needle that writes data to consecutive sectors on each platter
    - low cost
    - defragmentation required for best over-time performance
    - moving parts means bad choice for on-the-go devices
    - 5200 & 7200 RPM disk speeds available
    - typically uses SATA
    - speed for read and write at typically 80MB/s to 160MB/s
- SSD (Solid State Drive)
    - data is stored on non-volatile flash memory
    - typically uses SATA
    - no moving parts
    - speed for reads and writes at between 200MB/s to 550MB/s
- NVME (Non-Volatile Memory Express)
    - SSD that's attached to a PCI Express (PCIe) slot on a main board
    - read/write speeds of the top NVMe SSDs on the market can exceed 3000 MB/s (3 GB/s), with some Gen 4 NVMe PCIe SSDs capable of 7500 MB/s

- Hybrids
    - You can find SSD+HDD combo drives, and just released was a NVME+HDD drive
    - These are not as useful at the consumer level - these are now geared towards data centers

Within disk types, you have different companies, different disk tiers (read / write capabilities and speeds), warranty expectations, and disk class (consumer vs enterprise).

### Drive Interfaces / Protocols

- SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment)
    - data transfer of 600MB/s (4.8 Gb/s)
        - note: it is common to use 6Gb/s, but it doesn't factor in [base 10 to 8 conversion](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-SATA-III-connection-max-out-at-600-MB-s-read-and-write-speeds)
    - half-duplex (one directional) - cannot read and write simultaneously
- SAS (Serial Attached Small Computer System Interface)
    - data transfer of 1500 MB/s (12 Gb/s)
    - full-duplex - can read and write simultaneously
- PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)
    - PCIe 3.0â€™s throughput is 1GB per second per lane, providing an overall data transfer rate or bandwidth of up to 32GB/s total. 
    - PCIe 4.0 doubles the 3.0 throughput rate per lane, giving users a transfer rate of up to 64GB/s.
